 In this Project we will create UI where you can enter data, In the backgroud the data is stored in mysql db table.

Prerequisites:
  Create a db (here I used Mysql) and create a table by the name details with fields first name ,Lastname,age. You can change the type of db and table and the fields according to your requrements.  
  Export the credentials for the db using env varaibles DB_USER DB_PASSWORD DB_NAME.
     This application listens at port 8181 so keep this port open or else you can do port forward to some other port on your machine.
